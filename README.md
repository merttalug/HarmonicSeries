# HarmonicSeries
 The program that finds the harmonic series of the number requested as input from the users.

The harmonic series is the sum from n = 1 to infinity with terms 1/n. If you write out the first few terms, the series unfolds as follows: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +. . .etc.

As n tends to infinity, 1/n tends to 0.
